This is a Trojan horse implemented as a Minecraft mod. A malicious mod making use of this code would hide the trojan with some actual content, to make the mod appear legitimate.

This mod opens a backdoor that allows a Trojan Control Server to execute arbitrary Java code on the user's computer. This can make for some truly nasty malware; for example, a strain of this trojan
might execute code that starts digging through the user's personal files and sends them back to the control server. Another strain might destroy the user's files altogether.

This would likely be used more covertly; for example, it might be used to mine bitcoin for the hacker, or to launch a DDoS attack against an unfortunate victim. There are many possibilities for a trojan of this nature,
and the hacker is able to change its functionality on the fly. All he needs to do is write some code and tell the control server to serve that to the infected clients.
